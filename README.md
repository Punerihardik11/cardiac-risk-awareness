# Cardiac Risk Awareness System

An explainable machine learning–based project focused on **cardiac risk level stratification** (Low / Medium / High) using clinical and patient-reported features.

## Objective
To build an ethical, interpretable data science system that increases cardiac health awareness and supports better patient decision-making without providing medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Key Characteristics
- Risk **stratification**, not diagnosis
- Emphasis on **explainability and transparency**
- Uses publicly available cardiac health datasets
- Designed with ethical and clinical boundaries in mind

## Project Structure
- `data/` — raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` — data exploration, feature engineering, model training  
- `src/` — reusable Python source code  
- `docs/` — detailed project documentation  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  

## Disclaimer
This project is for educational and research purposes only.  
It does **not** provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment and should not be used as a substitute for professional healthcare consultation.
