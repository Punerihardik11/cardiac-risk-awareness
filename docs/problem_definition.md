# Problem Definition

## Background
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death in India.
Many heart-related conditions are silent, gradual, and often ignored until serious damage occurs.

## Problem Statement
Patients often:
- Fail to understand early warning signs
- Cannot clearly communicate symptoms to doctors
- Receive inconsistent or delayed guidance
- Lack long-term tracking of health behavior and risk

Doctors often:
- Have limited time per patient
- Rely on incomplete patient histories
- Cannot continuously monitor lifestyle factors

## Objective
To build an intelligent, patient-centered cardiac risk awareness platform that:
- Estimates heart disease risk using data-driven models
- Educates patients without inducing fear
- Encourages sustainable lifestyle changes
- Improves doctor–patient communication

## Scope (Initial Phase)
- Focus only on heart-related risk
- Use structured datasets (no diagnosis)
- Risk awareness, not medical prescription
- Educational and decision-support tool only

## Out of Scope
- No treatment recommendations
- No medication suggestions
- No emergency diagnosis

## Target Users
- Individuals seeking heart health awareness
- Patients tracking lifestyle and symptoms
- Doctors using summarized patient insights

## Ethical Considerations
- No replacement for medical professionals
- Transparent risk interpretation
- User data privacy and consent
